18:11:42 From Perry To Everyone:
	I don’t expect much from you little sisters
18:12:02 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	are you recording this?
18:14:27 From Dave Fuller To Everyone:
	https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
18:15:08 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	thank you
18:16:21 From Kevin Cole To Everyone:
	Hail all.
18:16:35 From David Fox To Everyone:
	hello from manassas!
18:16:42 From Dave Fuller To Everyone:
	https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
18:17:07 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	I'm installing the C++ compiler and it has a lot of options. which ones do we need?
18:17:23 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	Ctrl-C for me seems to not work half the time
18:17:35 From Trey To Everyone:
	From the website: "When asked which workloads to install make sure “C++ build tools” is selected and that the Windows 10 SDK and the English language pack components are included."
18:18:14 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	Thanks, Trey\
18:18:46 From Kevin Cole To Dave Fuller(Direct Message):
	I suggest moving the mic further from the keyboard if you can. (It's a bit like beat poetry: You're speaking to a muted bass drum beat.)
18:19:59 From David Fox To Everyone:
	ctrl-Z ?
18:20:06 From Samuel J Rembisz To Everyone:
	curl just downloads the html for the page
18:20:28 From David Fox To Everyone:
	that curl statement installs rustup—an installer tool for rust
18:20:43 From Dave Fuller To Kevin Cole(Direct Message):
	https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html
18:21:03 From David Fox To Everyone:
	curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
18:21:38 From meral To Dave Fuller(Direct Message):
	Downloaded
18:21:53 From Samuel J Rembisz To Everyone:
	I can't remember if rustup-init installs the build tools
18:21:59 From Samuel J Rembisz To Everyone:
	for windows
18:22:00 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	Surprise!
18:24:11 From David Fox To Everyone:
	ive been a software engineer for almost 20 years and im definitely still not good at it 🤣 but rust is cool 🙂
18:25:58 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	I started programming while attending the American School of Milan (Italy) on a dumb teletypewriter terminal connected to a Honeywell Mark 3 (I think) somewhere in Europe. No screen, paper tape, very loud keyboard
18:26:15 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	ASM = High School
18:26:58 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	I graduated with a Com SCI BS. I hated Calculus, Statistics, and Physics classes, though I do like reading physics now
18:28:29 From Michael P. To Everyone:
	good so far
18:28:33 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	It's still installing the C++ compiler
18:28:47 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	But please proceed.
18:28:53 From Lana To Everyone:
	still installing on Win 10
18:28:59 From Lubna To Everyone:
	I think I've installed everything now
18:29:09 From Michael P. To Everyone:
	refill!!
18:30:37 From Samuel J Rembisz To Everyone:
	Haha, I really enjoy Rust docs, but some people really dislike it
18:30:41 From Kevin Cole To Dave Fuller(Direct Message):
	Linux for the win! I started that early too, and became a RHCE (note the fedora). But these days, I'm into music. Ubuntu Studio + KX Studio. Haven't used Windows in over a decade.
18:31:59 From Lana To Everyone:
	so on Windows 10 should I open the cmd prompt?
18:32:04 From David Fox To Everyone:
	still havent figured out how best to navigate rust docs. best guess is i still dont really know what things are called
18:32:31 From Lana To Everyone:
	not sure
18:32:47 From Samuel J Rembisz To Everyone:
	Yeah, I don't find myself navigating the full docs when it comes to crates, I normally just google something and the page that I need comes up with full documentation and examples built in
18:33:57 From David Fox To Everyone:
	the examples in documentation are a pretty great feature
18:34:07 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	Yep, windows wants me to reboot so I'll hold off until after the meeting
18:34:54 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	all good
18:34:56 From Trey To Everyone:
	I'm fine with moving on!
18:35:22 From Kevin Cole To Everyone:
	"Forward! Into the past!" -- Firesign Theater
18:35:39 From dave To Everyone:
	@lana do you have Powershell?
18:36:17 From Lana To Everyone:
	i typed ssh in the cmd prompt
18:36:38 From Kevin Cole To Everyone:
	(On Windows, Start button, Search button, and search for PowerShell)
18:37:14 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	I still like Dos
18:37:17 From Kevin Cole To Everyone:
	Or Install the Linux Subsystem for Windows -- even better, but it takes longer.
18:37:17 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	command prompt
18:37:31 From David Fox To Everyone:
	its amazing
18:37:36 From Samuel J Rembisz To Everyone:
	good 'ol MS-DOS 5
18:39:45 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	I'm in Ashburn, next to Dulles Airport
18:40:13 From Lana To Everyone:
	im just learning Linux now.    win 10mis still installing...
18:40:34 From Trey To Everyone:
	I moved from rural Prince George to Midlothian about 8 months ago, and I'm loving having stores within 10 minutes from me now!
18:40:36 From Michael P. To Everyone:
	sorry all, I need to log :(  but will see you next meeting!
18:40:47 From Samuel J Rembisz To Everyone:
	@Lana Are you still installing the build tools? I will say this process is a lot easier on Linux
18:41:37 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	Will you be continuing this meetup?
18:41:51 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	Cool, thanks
18:42:53 From Kevin Cole To Everyone:
	Midlothian... Sounds like a place Frodo would have visited... 😉
18:43:10 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	i use Brackets or Notepad++
18:43:13 From Trey To Everyone:
	I used Notepad++ on Windows.
18:43:20 From Kevin Cole To Everyone:
	Notepad++ for windows, or Visual Studio Code
18:43:26 From Samuel J Rembisz To Everyone:
	If you "Save As" using notepad and change the file type to "Any *.*" it'll allow you to change the file extension
18:43:29 From Samuel J Rembisz To Everyone:
	but yeah
18:43:38 From Samuel J Rembisz To Everyone:
	please do not use notepad 😁
18:43:58 From Samuel J Rembisz To Everyone:
	Nah, much better
18:44:08 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	Notepad++ is Notepad on super steroids for coding
18:44:08 From Kevin Cole To Everyone:
	There's a way to set Notepad to default to doing the right thing, including not screw with line endings.
18:44:13 From David Fox To Everyone:
	https://code.visualstudio.com/
18:44:20 From Trey To Everyone:
	https://notepad-plus-plus.org/
18:44:22 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	both Notepad++ and Brackets are free
18:44:26 From Samuel J Rembisz To Everyone:
	vscode is my preferred on Linux next to nvim
18:44:48 From David Fox To Everyone:
	vscode has a massive extension marketplace, and there are fantastic rust tools
18:45:08 From Kevin Cole To Everyone:
	+1 to Trey's links to Notepad++ and Visual Studio Code. Are good choices.
18:45:17 From Samuel J Rembisz To Everyone:
	If anyone is looking for useful extensions for Rust once you get into the language, just ask me, there's a couple QOL tools that you can get
18:45:54 From Kevin Cole To Everyone:
	I'm an Emacs zealot, but "apt install code" puts visual studio code on your system/
18:46:01 From Samuel J Rembisz To Everyone:
	GitHub Copilot does that with Rust Analyzer and breaks everything ;(
18:49:00 From David Fox To Everyone:
	vi > emacs
18:49:12 From Trey To Everyone:
	+1 vim all the way
18:49:33 From Samuel J Rembisz To Everyone:
	imagine using an ide when you can echo your code and pipe it into your file
18:52:40 From Dave Fuller To Kevin Cole(Direct Message):
	https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html
18:54:54 From Samuel J Rembisz To Everyone:
	Anybody still on the installation?
18:56:16 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	If I'm not mistaken, the latest version of javascript have that too and constant means a variable. i'm so confuesed
18:56:20 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	*confused
18:56:43 From Samuel J Rembisz To Everyone:
	I think that's a fair criticism. I think the vocabulary is used for accessibility for programmers that have done programming work in the past. Mutable state is a big thing in Rust
18:56:45 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	As Spock would say, "That is illogical."
18:56:54 From Samuel J Rembisz To Everyone:
	Yes!
18:56:57 From Samuel J Rembisz To Everyone:
	Hahaha
18:57:09 From Samuel J Rembisz To Everyone:
	Constants are compile time. Immutable variables are created at runtime but don't change
18:57:21 From David Fox To Everyone:
	immutability is the umbrella computer science subject, and its familiar to programmers. it is horribly absent in so many other languages
19:01:55 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	yes, but separately
19:02:09 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	sof if you can send the recording and copy/paste the chat, that would be cool
19:03:37 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	Well, I demand my $1,000 back!
19:04:05 From Trey To Everyone:
	Wait, he only charged you $1000?
19:04:15 From David Fox To Everyone:
	same. im davidlfox on github
19:04:26 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	Yes, Trey, I got the "cool guy" discount
19:05:02 From Dave Fuller To Kevin Cole(Direct Message):
	On github I'm RATechnologies
19:05:11 From Kevin Cole To Dave Fuller(Direct Message):
	kjcole on github, ubuntourist on codeberg.org and gitlab
19:05:42 From Lubna To Everyone:
	gotta hop off. thank you! see everyone next week!
19:06:07 From Lana To Everyone:
	I had to reboot, it is finaly installed.
19:06:19 From Trey To Everyone:
	Same here, gotta go. Thanks for hosting the meetup! This has been fun.
19:06:38 From Samuel J Rembisz To Everyone:
	@Lana if you're here next week I can help getting you caught up!
19:07:18 From Lana To Everyone:
	ok that would be great @Samuel
19:08:54 From David Fox To Everyone:
	thanks a lot dave! looking forward to more meetups!@
19:08:56 From Joe Ganci To Everyone:
	next week, bring cookies
19:08:59 From Samuel J Rembisz To Everyone:
	Oh boy, have fun! Look forward to next week!
